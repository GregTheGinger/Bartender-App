NOTE: Was only able to use a local database. Have NO clue how to use a db with Visual Studio 2017. .NET Core 2.1 is much different than the 
framework that VS 2015 uses. 

When you launch the program to see my output it will crash on your machine due to the fact that the local db does not exsist on your machine.

What I was able to do:
  *Pass drinks from local db to Index
  *There is a queue
  *Was unable to get the HTTpGet /HTTpPost to pass the drinks from index to queue.
